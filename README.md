# ContingentAnalysis

Analysis scripts for the Contingent Motivation study.

written by John P Grogan, Tim R. Sandhu, & Sanjay G. Manohar. 2020.

These are the matlab (r2018b) scripts we wrote to analyse the behavioural and eyetracking data from the Contingent Motivation paper (Grogan et al., 2020, under submission).

The data can be downloaded here:

and it requires the following packages:

https://github.com/sgmanohar/matlib
https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39339-linear-regression-confidence-interval
https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30564-othercolor
https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11020-extended-dft

Unzip the repository, change the paths in ContigentDataLoad.m and ContigentDemographics.m to where the data was downloaded to, and add the above packages to your path.

Then run ContingentAnalysis.m
